    "The geometry creation file `Aircraft_Geometry.py` contains the `Update_Geometry()` function. The format follows .avl file format; information is broken down into the header, SURFACEs, SECTIONs, and CONTROLs. For ease of converting planform parameters into AVL-equivalents, the first few lines provide room to insert planform information. The user defines their header, SURFACEs, SECTIONs, and CONTROLs, and the AVL formatting is done automatically.\n",

    "## 2 Convention\n",
    "When naming variables in `Update_Geometry()`, include a three-digit number in the name (e.g., wing_section000, wing_section100, wing_section060). This is similar to G-code convention, where you leave space in between major steps to insert intermediate steps. This is not a major consideration for modern programming IDEs, but is more important for old fixed-format programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will find it useful to make 000 your root and 100 as your tip. If you were to make 1 your root and 2 your tip, then it does not make sense for 3 to go in-between. When you are defining upwards of ten sections in your wing, you may lose track of where sections 4 or 7 go. However, if you use the three-digit designation, it is intuitive where sections 043 and 077 are located relative to the root and tip. "

    "- `des_obj.assign()`: Assigns a new value to or overwrites existing values in the .config dictionary. Takes keyword-value pairs as arguments. Returns nothing.\n",
    "- `des_obj.__assign()`: Private method used for assigning values at object definition. Takes keyword-value pairs as arguments. Notifies the user if they keyword is not in the standard information. Returns nothing.\n",
    "- `des_obj.__lv_pair()`: Private method for writing \"label-value\" pairs to the .avl file. Uses the formatting keys in the design object to control newline printing for AVL keywords versus non-keyworded values. Takes key-item pairs in dictionary form and a boolean to control commenting. Returns nothing.\n",
    "- `des_obj.config_to_avl()`: Parses the design object .config and formatting information to call `__lv_pair()` automatically. Called for each design object when .avl file is written. Takes a string containing the .avl file contents. Returns nothing. \n",
    "- `des_obj.children()`: Prints the children of the design object. Takes nothing. Returns nothing.\n",
    "- `des_obj.parents()`: Prints the parents of the design object. Takes nothing. Returns nothing.\n",
    "- `des_plane.write_to_avl()`: Begins writing the design plane and all of its children to a .avl file. Used at the end of the geometry creation file. Belongs to the design plane object as the function calls `config_to_avl()` for each design object, looping through the child design surfaces, design sections, and design controls. Takes a filename as a string; assumed directory is \"AVL/Planes\". Returns nothing.\n",
    "- `des_plane.use_reference()`: Assigns a des_surf as the reference surface for the model. If used, the surface's span, mean aerodynamic chord, and area will be used as the header *bref*, *cref*, and *Sref* reference values. If not used, the reference values must be manually inputted. Takes a **des_surf** object. Returns nothing.\n",
    "- `des_surf.calculate_reference_values()`: Calculates the span, mean aerodynamic chord, and area of the surface. Stores the results in *des_surf.cref*, *des_surf.bref*, and *des_surf.Sref*\n",
    "- `des_surf.order()`: Takes the children of the **des_surf** object and orders them based on distance from the root. This is done to make sure the sections are written in order. Takes an integer input 0 for horizontal ordering (ordered by Yle) and 1 for vertical ordering (ordered by Zle). Returns nothing.\n",
    "- `des_sec.interp()`: Creates a new **des_sec** object using linear interpolation between two existing sections. Typically used for creating sections where control surfaces must be defined. Takes two existing **des_sec** objects, a float spanwise location, and integer orientation; orientation 0 is horizontal and uses Yle (span) as the independent variable, orientation 1 is vertical and uses Zle (height) as the independent variable.\n"
